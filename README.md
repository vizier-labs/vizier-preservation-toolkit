# Vizier Preservation Toolkit (v1.0)

The Vizier Preservation Toolkit is a browser-local system for structured multi-session AI work. It implements the core Vizier methodology:

- **State Ledger** – persistent checkpoints
- **Artifact Registry** – extracted code, drafts, notes
- **Restoration Prompt Generator** – rebuild projects reliably
- **Local-only storage** – no data is transmitted
- **One-file toolkit** – works directly in the browser

This project accompanies the [Vizier Beginner Guide](https://archive.org/details/viziers-beginner-guide-to-ai-projects-120725) and Vizier Advanced Guide. It enables consistent multi-session workflows across ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs.
