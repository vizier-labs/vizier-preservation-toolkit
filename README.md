Vizier Preservation Toolkit (v1.0)

The Vizier Preservation Toolkit is a browser-local system for structured multi-session AI work.
It implements the core Vizier methodology:

State Ledger – persistent checkpoints

Artifact Registry – extracted code, drafts, notes

Restoration Prompt Generator – rebuild projects reliably

Local-only storage – no data is transmitted

One-file toolkit – works directly in the browser

This project accompanies the Vizier Beginner Guide and Vizier Advanced Guide.
It enables consistent multi-session workflows across ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs.
